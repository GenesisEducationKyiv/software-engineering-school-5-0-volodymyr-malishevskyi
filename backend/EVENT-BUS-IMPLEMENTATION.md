# Event Bus Pattern Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented an event bus pattern to decouple subscription operations from notifications. The subscription service now emits events, and the notification module consumes them asynchronously.

## ✅ Event Bus Infrastructure
- **EventBus**: Central event bus using Node.js EventEmitter with proper error handling and logging
- **BaseEvent & DomainEvent**: Abstract base classes for all domain events with unique IDs and timestamps
- **Event Handler Interface**: Type-safe event handler contract for consumers

## ✅ Subscription Events
- **SubscriptionCreatedEvent**: Emitted when a subscription is created (pending confirmation)
- **SubscriptionConfirmedEvent**: Emitted when a subscription is confirmed
- **SubscriptionCancelledEvent**: Emitted when a subscription is cancelled

## ✅ Updated SubscriptionService
- Replaced direct notification service calls with event emission
- Maintained existing error handling and business logic
- Events are emitted after successful database operations
- Fixed type issues with subscription ID conversion

## ✅ Notification Event Consumer
- **SubscriptionEventConsumer**: Main consumer class with factory methods for handlers
- **Separate Handler Classes**: Individual handlers for each event type with proper logging
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and propagation for notification failures

## ✅ Dependency Injection Integration
- Registered EventBus as singleton in container
- Updated SubscriptionService to use EventBus instead of NotificationService
- Automatic event consumer initialization on application startup
- Proper handler registration for all subscription events

## ✅ Comprehensive Testing
- **Event Bus Unit Tests**: 14 tests covering subscription, publishing, error handling, and concurrent scenarios
- **SubscriptionService Unit Tests**: Updated all existing tests to verify event emissions instead of direct calls
- **Consumer Unit Tests**: 13 tests covering all event handlers, error scenarios, and edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of event flow from publishing to notification handling
- **Performance Tests**: Tested rapid event processing (50 concurrent events) and sequential ordering

## ✅ Quality Assurance
- All unit tests pass ✅
- All integration tests pass ✅
- TypeScript build succeeds without errors ✅
- Proper error handling and logging throughout ✅
- Maintains existing API compatibility ✅

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Loose Coupling**: Subscription service no longer directly depends on notification service
2. **Asynchronous Processing**: Events are handled asynchronously without blocking the main flow
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new event consumers without modifying existing code
4. **Error Resilience**: Event handling failures are logged but don't break the subscription flow
5. **Testability**: Clear separation of concerns makes testing easier and more focused
6. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring event flow

The implementation follows SOLID principles, maintains clean architecture, and includes robust error handling. The event bus pattern successfully decouples the subscription and notification modules while providing a reliable messaging system for inter-module communication.
